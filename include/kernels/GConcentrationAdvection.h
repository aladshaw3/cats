 *	\brief Kernel for use with the corresponding DGConcentrationAdvection object
 *	\details This file creates a standard MOOSE kernel that is to be used in conjunction with DGConcentrationAdvection
 *			for the discontinous Galerkin formulation of momentum advection in MOOSE. In order to complete the DG
 *			formulation of the advective physics, this kernel must be utilized with every variable that also uses
 *			the DGConcentrationAdvection kernel.

 *             of Technology by Austin Ladshaw for PhD research in the area
 *             of radioactive particle transport and settling following a
 *			   nuclear event. It was developed for the US DOD under DTRA
