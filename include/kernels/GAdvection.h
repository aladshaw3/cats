 *	\brief Kernel for use with the corresponding DGAdvection object
 *	\details This file creates a standard MOOSE kernel that is to be used in conjunction with the DGAdvection kernel
 *			for the discontinous Galerkin formulation of advection physics in MOOSE. In order to complete the DG
 *			formulation of the advective physics, this kernel must be utilized with every variable that also uses
 *			the DGAdvection kernel.
