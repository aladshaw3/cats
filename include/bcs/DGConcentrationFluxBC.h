 *	\brief Boundary Condition kernel for the flux of concentration/density across a boundary of the domain
 *	\details This file creates a generic boundary condition kernel for the flux of matter accross
 *			a boundary. The flux is based on a velocity vector and is valid
 *			in all directions and all boundaries of a DG method. Since the DG method's flux boundary
 *			conditions are essitially the same for input and ouput boundaries, this kernel will check
 *			the sign of the flux normal to the boundary and determine automattically whether it is
 *			an output or input boundary, then apply the appropriate conditions.
