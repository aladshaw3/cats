 *    \brief AuxKernel kernel to calculate pore diffusion coefficients in microscale
 *    \details This file is responsible for calculating the pore diffusivity
 *              for the microscale given some simple properties. Calculation is based
 *              diffusivities that are corrected via an Arrhenius like
 *              expression from a reference diffusivity and reference temperature.
 *              User provides input units for specific parameters and provides
 *              desired unit basis of the calculation of diffusivity.
