 *	\brief Discontinous Galerkin kernel for anisotropic diffusion
 *	\details This file creates a discontinous Galerkin kernel for anisotropic diffusion in a given domain. It is a generic
 *			diffusion kernel that is meant to be inherited from to make a more specific kernel for a given problem. The
 *			physical parameter in this kernel's formulation is a diffusion tensor. That tensor can be built piecewise by
 *			the respective components of the tensor at a given quadrature point.
 *
 *      The DG method for diffusion involves 2 correction parameters:
 *
 *          (1) sigma - penalty term that should be >= 0 [if too large, it may cause errors]
 *          (2) epsilon - integer term with values of either -1, 0, or 1
 *
 *      Different values for epsilon result in slightly different discretizations:
 *
 *          (1) epsilon = -1   ==>   Symmetric Interior Penalty Galerkin (SIPG)
 *                                   Very efficient for symmetric problems, but may only
 *                                   converge if sigma is high.
 *          (2) epsilon = 0    ==>   Incomplete Interior Penalty Galerkin (IIPG)
 *                                   Works well for non-symmetic, well posed problems, but
 *                                   only converges under same sigma values as SIPG.
 *          (3) epsilon = 1    ==>   Non-symmetric Interior Penalty Galerking (NIPG)
 *                                   Most stable and easily convergable method that can
 *                                   work for symmetic and non-symmetric systems. Much
 *                                   less dependent on sigma values for convergence.

 *
 *	\note Any DG kernel under DGOSPREY will have a cooresponding G kernel (usually of same name) that must be included
 *		with the DG kernel in the input file. This is because the DG finite element method breaks into several different
 *		residual pieces, only a handful of which are handled by the DG kernel system and the other parts must be handled
 *		by the standard Galerkin system. This my be due to some legacy code in MOOSE. I am not sure if it is possible to
 *		lump all of these actions into a single DG kernel.
