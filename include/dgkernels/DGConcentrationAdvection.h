*	\brief Discontinous Galerkin kernel for density advection
*	\details This file creates a discontinous Galerkin kernel for density advection in a given domain. It is a generic
*			advection kernel that is meant to be inherited from to make a more specific kernel for a given problem.
*
*	\note Any DG kernel under FENNEC will have a cooresponding G kernel (usually of same name) that must be included
*		with the DG kernel in the input file. This is because the DG finite element method breaks into several different
*		residual pieces, only a handful of which are handled by the DG kernel system and the other parts must be handled
*		by the standard Galerkin system. This my be due to some legacy code in MOOSE. I am not sure if it is possible to
*		lump all of these actions into a single DG kernel.
