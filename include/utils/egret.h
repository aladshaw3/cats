 *	\brief Estimation of Gas-phase pRopErTies
 *	\details This file is responsible for estimating various temperature, pressure, and concentration
 *		dependent parameters to be used in other models for gas phase adsorption, mass transfer,
 *		and or mass transport. The goal of this file is to eliminate redundancies in code such
 *		that the higher level programs operate more efficiently and cleanly. Calculations made
 *		here are based on kinetic theory of gases, ideal gas law, and some emperical models that
 *		were developed to account for changes in density and viscosity with changes in temperature
 *		between standard temperatures and up to 1000 K.
