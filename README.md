Catalytic After Treatment System (CATS)

This MOOSE module is used to simulate catalysis reactions in the exhaust systems for vehicles. It combines SUPG methods for exhaust gas flow around the catalyst material and uses DG methods to simulate the mass balances of all gaseous species in the gas stream, as well as perform energy balances for thermal distribution in the catalyst. 

WARNING: Module is currently under development! Use with caution!
