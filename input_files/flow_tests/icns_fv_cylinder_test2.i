# NOTE: As viscosity gets smaller, the velocity distribution
#       becomes more uniform.

# NOTE: If you put outlet pressure as 0, then what gets solved
#       for is the approximate pressure differential (dP)

# NOTE: Cannot solve immediately for very high velocity when
#       starting from 0 initial condition. You should properly
#       initialize velocity before trying to put a massive
#       flow into the system
