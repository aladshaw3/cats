# This input file tests various options for the incompressible NS equations in a channel.

# CONVERGES WELL

# NOTES
# -------
# There are multiple types of stabilization possible in incompressible
# Navier Stokes. The user can specify supg = true to apply streamline
# upwind petrov-galerkin stabilization to the momentum equations. This
# is most useful for high Reynolds numbers, e.g. when inertial effects
# dominate over viscous effects. The user can also specify pspg = true
# to apply pressure stabilized petrov-galerkin stabilization to the mass
# equation. PSPG is a form of Galerkin Least Squares. This stabilization
# allows equal order interpolations to be used for pressure and velocity.
# Finally, the alpha parameter controls the amount of stabilization.
# For PSPG, decreasing alpha leads to increased accuracy but may induce
# spurious oscillations in the pressure field. Some numerical experiments
# suggest that alpha between .1 and 1 may be optimal for accuracy and
# robustness.

# Parameters given below provide the best tested compromise of stability and accuracy

# NOTE: If you want an approximate steady-state flow profile, use MAXIMUM STABILITY options (alpha = 1.0 and all set to true)
#       and simulate for many time steps.
